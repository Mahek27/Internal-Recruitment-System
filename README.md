# Internal-Recruitment-System
<p>•	Organizations consider whether they recruit internally or externally. Many employers prefer to conduct internal recruitment first and turn to external recruitment only if internal efforts are unsuccessful.</p>
<p>•	It was designed to simplify hiring process and save valuable time by helping to choose the right candidates, manage talent pool and strengthen team collaboration.</p>
<p>•	Internal recruitments are less expensive because there are little to no recruiting fees, and they generally don't require extensive training, referral bonuses, or travel and relocation costs. Internal recruitments are also usually quicker.</p>
<p>•	For an internal hire, the process may be completed within a few weeks. </p>
<p>•	Internal hires usually have the support of managers and readily available performance review documents, and managers have a good sense of the strengths of the employee. It can also be easier for employees to succeed at a new job in the same company because they already have workplace connections and knowledge of the corporate culture. </p>
<p>•	Primary importance also is the fact that internal recruitment is good for employee morale. If employees constantly see positions being filled externally, they may feel that they have no future at their organization and may lose motivation or resign for a better opportunity elsewhere.</p>
